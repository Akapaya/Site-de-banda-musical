# HTML Project: Music band website

Welcome to my HTML repository, where I share my project developed as part of the IT technical course.

## Project description

### Music band website
It's a website created when I was learning HTML CSS and JavaScript, our theme was musical bands and we created a slightly darker style for rock.
